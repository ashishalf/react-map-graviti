# Map App in RaectJS

This project aims to create a simple one-page web app using ReactJS/NextJS that allows users to input an origin and destination, plot the route on maps, and display the distance. Users also have the option to add multiple stops along the route, which become waypoints between the origin and destination. Input validation ensures that only valid locations from Google Maps autosuggest are accepted for origin and destination inputs.
